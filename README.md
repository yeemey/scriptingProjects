PEDvPUDplot.py
--------------

This script is run through the command line interface.  
> `python PEDvPUDplot.py`  

It reads the distance matrix output file from SDT 1.0, and the Tree-Puzzle 5.2 maximum likelihood distance output file for the uncorrected and evolutionary distances, respectively, and plots the distances in a scatterplot.  
The plot is saved as a PNG file. The script also outputs a text file containing the pairwise sequences, and associated uncorrected and evolutionary distances. Both output files are in the same folder as the script.
